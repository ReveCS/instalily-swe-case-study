## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    *   Open a terminal in the **project root directory** (`partselect-agents/`).
    *   If you created a virtual environment, make sure it's activated.
    *   Run the application:
        ```bash
        python run_app.py
        ```
    *   Keep this terminal open. It will show server logs.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    *   Open a **second terminal**.
    *   Navigate to the **frontend directory**:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```
    *   Start the frontend:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    *   This will usually compile the frontend code and open the application in your default web browser (often at `http://localhost:3000` or a similar address). Check the terminal output for the exact URL.
